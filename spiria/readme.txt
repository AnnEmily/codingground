This project will find all solutions by brute force to this question :

  "Given a vector of integers, find all combinations of operations
   (restricted to + - * /) between the numbers to reach a given target"

Conditions : 
  - all numbers in the vector must be used
  - divide is not allowed if its result is not integer
  - if no solution found, give the closest result
  
Program is command line. Arguments (source vector and target) should be changed in main.cpp
